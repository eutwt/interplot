interplot
=========

`interplot` is a tool for plotting the conditional coefficients ("marginal effects") of variables included in multiplicative interaction terms. The function plots the changes in the coefficient of one variable in a two-way interaction term conditional on the value of the other included variable. The plot also includes simulated 95% confidential intervals of these coefficients.

To install:

* the latest released version: `install.packages("interplot")`.
* the latest developing version: `remotes::install_github("sammo3182/interplot")`.
